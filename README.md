## Mindful ##

Mindful is a simple, modular, open source mobile web application meant to serve as an experiment for others wanting to learn about front-end development and prototyping tools [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org), [Ratchet](http://maker.github.com/ratchet), and [Bower](http://twitter.github.com/bower). This app also makes use of [Express](http://expressjs.com/) as a server for the app, [Require](http://requirejs.org/) for delivering all them crazy js files, and maybe a few other things. We'll see.

### Getting Started ###
Make sure you have [Node](http://nodejs.org), [NPM](http://npmjs.org) and [Bower](http://twitter.github.com/bower) installed. You should probably install them in that order as well.

Then, just run this commands -

1. `$ git clone git@github.com:robbschiller/mindful.git`
2. `$ npm install` to install your node dependancies to build the server
3. `$ bower install` to install your front-end dependancies to build on top of the server
4. `$ node server.js` to fire up the app!
5. Go to localhost:3000 in your browser
6. Break some stuff!
